# Memories for a lifetime

Published on: 2023-09-28

So I shifted to Ireland and have been living here for the past 2 weeks. A part of me still want this to end this as a bad dream and take me back to the person who I loved with no boundaries.Abraham Raji, the person who is my home. Being a person who was filled with insecurities and no trust in love I never thought about meeting someone who will accept me as who I am. I never had to hide anything from him, neither did he. We believed this to be the most perfect partner we both could find. We were not the best humans alive. But we were right for each other. 
<p>I reached here 2 weeks ago and I can't accept the past 2 weeks of my life. I can't believe the man I decided to spend my whole life with is no more. I can't believe we won't be sleeping with our laptop screens by our bedside telling each other about our day. I can't believe that he won't be coming here in a few months to build a family with me. I am in the most unrealistic mindset while I write this and I don't know if I will ever come out of this. 
May be I will keep writing about this wonderful human being so that I have a reason to move forward. Accepting things is hard and moving on is harder. This is me trying to letting the piled up emotions in me out in a way he would have loved. This is for him. 
This feels like a rant and its exactly that. I don't have the energy to re read this and this will remain here as long to remind me why I am here.
Just quoting him here "We don't write blogs for getting an audience, building a network or getting famous. We do it to validate ourself.Its to make oursleves feel that our feelings are real and one day someone is going to read it and feel that they are not alone. Even if no one does, you can look back at it and see where you are now."

And he also said people don't care much about styling as long as its readable.

# What does privillege actually look like?

Published on: 2023-12-08

Everything around me appears to be light and grey. That's a poetic way of saying it, but what I mean is that I can't sleep at night and can't wake up in the morning. I was the girl who had everything under control. And now I'm not sure if I'll earn my master's degree or return to India as the girl who was so privileged that she couldn't realize the opportunity life was offering her to succeed.Â I've always been a daydreamer. I am still. The only difference was that I had dreams in my hands. But now I dream of the impossible. Like time travel, making different life decisions, and being happy. 
I'm now in exam mode, and nothing appears to be going well. Like the biriyani I created, my relationships with my family, friends, colleagues, and even myself are all mixed up.
'I don't even have a pla,' she says. Yes, Phoebe, I understand.

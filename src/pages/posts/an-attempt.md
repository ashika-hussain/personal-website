# An Attempt

Published on: 2023-08-22

Yesterday I tried studying a new web framework and I realised I am unable to understand
new concepts and make use of my thinking capacity to the fullest. I assume the
reason is that my B.Tech course was pretty much about the surface level of concepts.
And the first year in my career wasn't really challenging . If I am right, last
time I used my brain in full capacity was in Sept 2021.

  <ul>
	<li> Life can get boring when
		you can't consume a lot of information and I believe social media has actually
		played a vital role in reducing my capacity.
		So as part of being responsible
		to myself,I have decided not to use social media in the day time and surely not
		before bed.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Next, make my basics strong. Revise what I already know. Refresh your memory. One thing I realised about programming is that its one big base and everything is build on that.
		Learn how one thing is different from other.
	  </li>
	  <li> Read every bit of information. One thing about living in the generation controlled by algorithms and AI is that you can show them what you like. Tell your youtube that you would like to watch people talk about programming.
	  </li>
  </ul>

I really hope this works out. *Fingers crossed
